# Player Highlighter

A lightweight **client-side Fabric mod** that highlights players with a glowing outline while the player list is visible, without relying on any server-side mechanics.

---

## Overview

Player Outline Highlighter improves player visibility by showing a glowing outline around players **only when the player list menu is displayed**.  
The effect is temporary, purely visual, and handled entirely on the client.

Once the player list menu is closed, all outlines disappear immediately.
